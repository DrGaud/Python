#This exercise is getting used to printing commands through python to the terminal#
print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again!"
# This next Print command has a use of different keyboard characters to see if it prints okay-it does#
print "I like this =) "
print "I like typing like this"
print "Yay ! Printing"
#These next two Print commands alternate th use of the "" and '' within the parenthesis of the command
#Each of these have to be concise, the opening parenthesis HAS TO BE USED TO CLOSE# 
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this'
