Ex17 test

Here I will write a short poem
About a man
Who thought he was a god
He conquered all
Beloved as he was
Then one day he died
He was a god nomore

THe folk who worshiped the god
realised they couldnt live without
they were devoted to him
Delirious with loved
They started to lose themselves

Generations that preceeded the god
only knew of him from lore
they worshipped him as he was then
they idolised him 
tokens that cost themselves a price
one they didnt reconcile over time
poorer and poorer they became

but the love they displayed for him
still can be seen today
lost are those generations 
all withered away through the ages
leaving only their tokens
of their devotion 
to a god that didnt know their name
